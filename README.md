# (WIP) rox
Rust implementation of Lox from [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), heavily inspired by [@brightly-salty/rox](https://github.com/brightly-salty/rox)

This is a 'for fun' project to help me better understand low-level programming.

Most of the code will look similar to the above-mentioned repository as I am using it for reference, but I will, along the way, add things that I think are missing, including:

1) better defined errors as seen in `errors.rs`,
2) tests.
